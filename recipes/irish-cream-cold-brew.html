    <p><em>A drink birthed in Ireland!</em></p>
    <p>The irish Cream Cold Brew is a <em>holiday exclusive</em> at Starbucks. This drink is unlike any cold brew I have had! I recommend you follow along and find out for yourself!</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>8 oz Cold Brew or Iced Coffee</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp Irish Cream Syrup</li>
        <li>1/4 cup 2% milk (whole milk optional)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp vanilla syrup</li>
        <li>dash of cocoa</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the cold brew or iced coffee to a glass along with the Irish cream syrup. Use a spoon and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>To make the cold foam, add the milk and vanilla syrup to a glass. Use an electric frother and whip until the milk has turned into a thick foam. If you do not have a frother, add the ingreients to a mason jar, seal, then shake until thick and foamy.</li> 
        <li>Add ice to your glass, if desired, then slowly pour on the vanilla cold foam.</li>
        <li>Add a dash of cocoa and enjoy immediately.</li>
    </ol>
