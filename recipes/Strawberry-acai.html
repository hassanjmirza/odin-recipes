    <p><em>A refreshing drink!</em></p>
    <p>You may remember the Strawbery Acai refresher from Starbucks. However, have you ever wanted to make one from the comfort of your own home? Of course you have, and I am here to help!</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 c Water</li>
        <li>2 tsp passion fruit puree, 1/4 tsp at a time to adjust flavor</li>
        <li>2 1/2 c White grape juice</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tsp freeze-dried strawberry (powder)</li>
        <li>1 tsp freeze-dried acai (powder)</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp green coffee bean extract (powder)</li>
        <li>Ice</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add powdered ingredients with a few tablespoons of water and stir until dissolved. This will make a slurry (a loose paste) ensuring you don't have large chunks of powder throughout.</li>
        <li>Once the powder is thoroughly mixed, slowly stir in the last bit of water, passion fruit puree and white grape juice. I use a glass jar with a lid to break up any excess powder.</li>
        <li>Serve over ice with freeze-dried, frozen, or fresh strawberries.</li>
    </ol>
